**sass.cr** provides a Sass/SCSS to CSS compiler for [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) through bindings to [`libsass`](https://github.com/sass/libsass/).

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sass:
    github: straight-shoota/sass.cr
```

### Building `libsass`
There is currently no binary distribution of `libsass`, so you need to build it yourself (see [Building instructions for `libsass`](https://github.com/sass/libsass/blob/master/docs/build.md)).

The included [Makefile](Makefile) contains a target `install-libsass` to install `libsass` in a global path (usually `/usr/local/lib`).
You can also run `make dep` to install `libsass` in a local path specified by `$LOCAL_LD_PATH` (by default this is `./dynlib`).

These bindings have been tested with version `3.4.5` and `3.5.0.beta.3` of `libsass`.

## Usage

```crystal
require "sass"

# Compile a Sass/SCSS file:
css = Sass.compile_file("application.scss")

# Compile a Sass/SCSS file with options:
css = Sass.compile_file("application.sass", include_path: "includes")

# Compile a Sass/SCSS string:
css = Sass.compile("body { div { color: red; } }")

# Re-use compiler with options:
compiler = Sass::Compiler.new(include_path: "includes", precision: 4)
compiler.include_path += ":other_includes"
css_application = compiler.compile_file("application.scss")
css_layout = compiler.compile(%(@import "layout";))
```
